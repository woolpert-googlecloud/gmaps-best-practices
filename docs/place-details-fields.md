# Place Details Field Filtering

Pricing for Places API requests is tiered and based on which categories of fields are returned. Google differentiates between **Basic**, **Contact**, and **Atmosphere** fields. Basic data is included in the cost of each Places API service but requesting Contact and/or Atmosphere fields costs extra.

> üìö For more on how Places API requests are billed, see our guide: [Understanding Places API Billing](places-api-billing)

In June 2018, Google introduced a new `fields` parameter to Places API, so developers can control what is returned, and only pay for data they need. Because this is an additional parameter, you will have to change your code to filter your requests and reduce your cost.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è For backward compatibility, Places API returns **all fields** by default.

Your existing applications will be billed for all three categories of data if you don't change your code to add field filtering. This affects all users of the places library for the *Google Maps JavaScript API* (including *Place Autocomplete*), the mobile *Places SDKs for Android & iOS*, and all *web service* requests.

This guide will help you determine which fields you need and how to add field filtering to your code.


## Which Fields Do You Need?

Here is a breakdown of the fields included in each category. Evaluate which of these are being used in your application, and note which category they fall into.

| SKU | Fields |
| --- | --- |
| **Basic** | `address_component`, `adr_address`, `alt_id`, `formatted_address`, `geometry` (location), `icon`, `id`, `name`, `permanently_closed`, `photo`, `place_id`, `plus_code`, `scope`, `type`, `url`, `utc_offset`, `vicinity` |
| **Contact** | `formatted_phone_number`, `international_phone_number`, `opening_hours`, `website` |
| **Atmosphere** | `price_level`, `rating`, `review` |

See the [Place Details results documentation](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/details#PlaceDetailsResults) for detailed descriptions of each field.

## Filter Your Places API Requests

### Web Service Requests
When making **Place Details** requests through the web service, add a `field=` parameter to the URL, followed by a comma-separated list of the fields you want returned.

***Example** - Return only the name, address, and location for a place (**Basic**):*
```
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/details/json?placeid=ChIJlQ-ho9OEQIgRLQeLM-VMRMc&fields=name,formatted_address,address_component,geometry&key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

***Example** - Return only the name and hours of operation for a place (**Basic + Contact**):*
```
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/details/json?placeid=ChIJlQ-ho9OEQIgRLQeLM-VMRMc&fields=name,opening_hours&key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

***Example** - Return only the name and rating for a place (**Basic + Atmosphere**):*
```
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/details/json?placeid=ChIJlQ-ho9OEQIgRLQeLM-VMRMc&fields=name,rating&key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Nearby** and **Text Searches** do not have field filtering capability, they will always generate Contact and Atmosphere charges.

### Google Maps JavaScript API

The Places library for the Google Maps JavaScript API has field filtering built in.

#### Place Autocomplete Widget

If you're using Google's built-in Place Autocomplete widget, set a filter by adding the `fields` property to the [options object](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/places-widget#AutocompleteOptions) you pass to the `Autocomplete` constructor. The property is an `Array<string>`, containing the names of the fields you want returned.

```js
var autocomplete = new google.maps.places.Autocomplete(
  document.getElementById("autocomplete-input"),
  {
    fields: ["name", "address_component", "formatted_address", "geometry.location"]
  }
);
```

You can also change the filter at any time by calling the `setFields` function and passing an `Array<string>` of field names.
```js
autocomplete.setFields(["name", "formatted_address", "opening_hours"]);
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The Places `SearchBox` does not support field filtering, and will be billed for all three categories of data. If possible, use `Autocomplete` instead.

#### Places Service

If you are using a `PlacesService` instance for **Find Place** or **Place Details** queries (including `AutocompleteService` implementations), set a filter by adding the `fields` property to the [request object](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/places-service#PlaceDetailsRequest) you pass to the following functions: `findPlaceFromPhoneNumber`, `findPlaceFromQuery`, `getDetails`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The `nearbySearch` and `textSearch` functions do not support field filtering, and will be billed for all three categories of data.

```js
var autocomplete = new google.maps.places.Autocomplete(
  var placesService = new google.maps.places.PlacesService("places-attr-container"),
  placesService.getDetails({
    placeId: "ChIJlQ-ho9OEQIgRLQeLM-VMRMc",
    fields: ["name", "address_component", "formatted_address", "geometry.location"]
  }
);

function callback(place, status){
  if (status == google.maps.places.PlacesServiceStatus.OK) {
    console.log(place);
  }
}
```

### Places Mobile SDKs for Android/iOS

The current versions of the Places mobile SDKs for Android and iOS do not support field filtering. Google is working on new versions of the SDKs that will include field filtering as well as other new Maps Platform capabilities. Once Google releases those new versions, the current SDKs will be deprecated. Until that time, mobile Places API through the SDKs is free, following the old Standard Plan model.
