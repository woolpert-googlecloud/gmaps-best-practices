# Maps Platform Best Practices
As a Premier Partner in Google's ecosystem, the Woolpert team sees a lot of common mistakes and unoptimized usage out in the wild. Therefore, we put together this repository to help Maps Platform developers optimize their code and get the most out of Google's APIs. Here you'll find a mix of best practice guides, example code, and links to helpful resources.
